**Version:** 9.3  
**Author:** Kusanalee  
**Base Engine:** Translucence (by CapnKitten)  
**Type:** Vencord Theme (works with Vencord & OpenAsar)

A breathtakingly beautiful **liquid-glass** theme that turns your entire Discord client into floating midnight-blue frosted crystal. Built specifically for **Vencord**, it uses the full power of Translucence’s blur engine to deliver real-time refraction, animated shine, micro-noise, and that signature “wet glass” look.

This is the exact same visual masterpiece as the BetterDiscord version — now perfectly adapted for Vencord users.

## Features

- 55 px backdrop blur + 230 % saturation + 135 % brightness “liquid refraction”
- Deep Tahoe-style blue glass tints with perfect readability
- Every panel is a floating frosted card with inner glow + deep shadows
- Pill-shaped glassy servers, folders, buttons, and chat input
- Subtle animated shine + micro-noise that reacts to whatever’s behind Discord
- Full Discord variable bridge → 100 % future-proof
- macOS-style translucent title bar & refined search bars
- Works flawlessly with Vencord’s built-in transparency & OpenAsar

## Installation (Vencord)

1. Make sure you have **Vencord** installed → https://vencord.dev
2. Open Discord → Settings → **Vencord** → **Themes**
3. Click **“Open Themes Folder”**
4. Download the theme file and drop it in:  
   → [LiquidGlasscord.theme.css][(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kusanaliee/liquid-glasscord-vencord/main/LiquidGlasscord.theme.css)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kusanalee/LiquidGlassCord/refs/heads/main/LiquidGlassCord.css)
5. Back in Vencord settings → enable **Liquid Glasscord**

That’s it — no extra steps, no Translucence plugin needed (it’s imported directly).

## Recommended Settings

For maximum liquid goodness:
- Vencord → **Settings** → **Vencord** → Enable **“Client Transparency”** (or use Acrylic/Mica on Windows)
- Use a dark or dynamic wallpaper — the theme lives for what’s behind it ♡
